Hey everyone!

I thought that a great way to finally learn how to use git would
be to upload all the code that I have been working on at at school.
Not all of the problems are complete, so feel free to contribute.
Im sure I will look back at this in a year or so and jump in fright
at how atrocious my coding prose was, but hey, you gotta start
somewhere!

Peace!
